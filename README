--  aim to build a general neural net whose num of layers, num of nodes in each layer & neuron activity in each layer can be arbitrarily specified. 
--  training is using back-propagation
    supporting python3, no warrant for python2

--  To run the test: start from this dir, then `python -m test.test` (run as a module)

--  you can choose to profile the net performance
    metrics such as cost is populated into database
    --  you can inspect it using sqlite3
        common problem about sqlite3:
        direction key may not work as expected in the sqlite3 shell, due to problem of readline lib
        easiest work around for this:
        `rlwrap sqlite3 <db_name>`
        (could then alias sqlite to 'rlwrap sqlite3')
    --  you can visualize db data using other tools, such as *benchtracker*

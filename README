--  aim to build a general neural net whose num of layers, num of nodes in each layer & neuron activity in each layer can be arbitrarily specified. 
--  training is using back-propagation
--  supporting python3, no guarantee about python2

--  To run the test: start from this dir, then `python -m test.test`

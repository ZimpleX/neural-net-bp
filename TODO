change this from text based to db based
---------------------------------------
--  every directory now becomes a *.db file
--  no conf file is needed: you can tell from attribute name (t0, t1, ..., x0, x1, ..., x1+x2,...)
--  no need for multiple files: single db with large enough entry will suffice
--  db name should contain input / output range
